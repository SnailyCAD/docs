Weapon registration is a critical process enabling individuals to officially record ownership and essential details of a firearm or any other type of weapon.
This includes information such as the weapon type, make, model, serial number, and owner details.

You can register a weapon by clicking "Register Weapon" on the Citizen Dashboard.

This will open a modal where you can enter the details of the weapon you wish to register.
