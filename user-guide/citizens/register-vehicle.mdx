Vehicle registration is a fundamental process allowing individuals to officially record ownership and essential details of a vehicle.
This includes information such as the make, model, color, license plate, and owner details.

You can register a vehicle by pressing the "Register Vehicle" button on the Citizen Dashboard.

This will open a modal where you can enter the details of the vehicle you wish to register.
