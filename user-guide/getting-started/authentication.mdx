### Registration Code

Some communities may have a registration code enabled, which means you will need to enter a code to successfully register an account.
If you do not have the registration code, you will need to get this from your community.

### Whitelist Only

After signing up, some communities may have a review process enabled, which means you will need to wait for an administrator to review your account before you can login.
If this is the case, you will see a message on the login page stating that your account is pending.
