# Invalid Database Credentials

This error is thrown when the database credentials are incorrect. This can be caused by a typo in the `.env`, invalid password or invalid username.

## Ways to fix it

- Make your credentials are correct to the database. Double check for typos and make sure the database is running.
- [Reset your database password](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-administration/postgresql-reset-password/)

## Tips

- The default username for PostgreSQL is `postgres` (`POSTGRES_USER`).
- The most common `DB_HOST` is `localhost`.
- If you installed `PgAdmin`, it should've asked to enter a password during install, you must enter the same password in your .env file.
