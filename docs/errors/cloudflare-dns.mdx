# Cloudflare DNS Issues

When using Cloudflare as DNS, you're required to update some settings for SnailyCAD to properly work.

## 1. Disable Brotli caching

1. Open your site on the dasboard
2. Head to Speed -> Optimizations
3. Look for and disable "Brotli"

![Brotli Caching](/brotli-cache.png)

## 2. Set caching level

1. Head to Caching -> Configuration
2. Look for "Caching Level"
3. Set it to `No query string`

![set cache level](/brotli-cache.png)

## 3. Set Cache TTL

1. Head to Caching -> Configuration
2. Look for "Browser Cache TTL"
3. Set to `Respect Existing Headers`

![set cache ttl](/cache-ttl.png)

## 4. Done

You should have now successfully configured Cloudflare to support SnailyCAD.
