# Cloudflare DNS Issues

When using Cloudflare as DNS, you're required to update some settings for SnailyCAD to properly work.

## 1. Disable Brotli caching

1. Open your site on the dasboard
2. Head to Speed -> Optimization -> Content Optimization
3. Look for and disable "Brotli" (Usually the first option)

## 2. Set caching level

1. Head to Caching -> Configuration
2. Look for "Caching Level"
3. Set it to `No query string`

## 3. Set Cache TTL

1. Head to Caching -> Configuration

3. Set to `Respect Existing Headers`
