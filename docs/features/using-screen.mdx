# Running Snailycad with `screen` in Linux

You can run snailycad under a screen so you can safely close the terminal/ssh window without risking it closing out on you!

## Creating a `screen` session

First you need to create the screen by running the following command:

_You can change `snailycad` to whatever it's just a name nothing important_

```
screen -S snailycad
```

after you enter it, it will immediately open a screen session here you can goto your snailycad folder and run:

```bash
yarn run concurrently "yarn workspace @snailycad/client start" "yarn workspace @snailycad/api generate && yarn workspace @snailycad/api start"
```

Afterwards do CTRL A + X (DO NOT CTRL C IT WILL CLOSE THE CAD!)

## Re-open a `screen` session

If you want to reopen that session you can list all the screens using the following command:

```bash
screen -list
```

## Reconnect to a `screen` session

to reconnect to an existing screen like the one you created run the following command:

```bash
screen -r -D snailycad
```

again change `snailycad` to your screen name!
