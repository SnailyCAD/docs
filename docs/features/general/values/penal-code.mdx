This defines the penal codes that can be used when creating tickets, arrest reports and written warnings.

There are 2 options that can be both selected. When **only 1 is selected**, it means the following:

- `Warning Applicable`: penal code is only available for creating written warnings.
- `Warning Not Applicable`: penal code is only available for creating tickets and arrest reports.

When **both are selected**, it means the penal code is available for both written warnings and tickets and arrest reports.
