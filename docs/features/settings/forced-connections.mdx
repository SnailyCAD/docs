# Forced Connections

Forced connections requires users to sync third party services with their CAD account **after registration**.
This can be useful when you want each CAD user to have a third party account linked to their CAD account.

:::info
This is only supported since SnailyCAD version `1.47.0`
:::

### Supported services

- [Discord](/docs/discord-integration/discord-authentication)
- [Steam](/docs/steam-integration/steam-authentication)

## Example

In this example `Force Discord Auth` has been enabled.
This means that users will be required to link their Discord account before they can continue using SnailyCAD.
