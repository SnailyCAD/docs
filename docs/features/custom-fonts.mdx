# Installing custom fonts

SnailyCADv4 allows you to install custom fonts. This guide will show you how.

## 1. Downloading the font

You must download your font as a `.woff2` or `.ttf` type.

## 2. Adding the font to the client

Once you've downloaded your font, it needs to be placed in a special folder: `packages/client/public/fonts`.
If the `public/fonts` folder does not exist yet, you can create it.

Once created, place your font in the `/public/fonts` folder.

## 3. Including the font in the client

We must now edit some code to include this font in the client. Open the file: `packages/client/src/styles/fonts.scss`.

Now add the following to the file:

```scss
@font-face {
  font-family: "MyFontNameHere";
  src: url("../../public/fonts/MyFontNameHere.woff2");
}
```

Once you've added the font-face to the file, we must now update the old font name to the new font name.
Search for:

```scss
html,
body {
  font-family: "Assistant", sans-serif;
}
```

and **Replace with:**

```scss
html,
body {
  font-family: "MyFontNameHere", sans-serif;
}
```

## 4. Re-building the client.

Once you've followed all the steps **correctly**, we can now re-build the client. First stop the CAD, then run the following command:

```sh
yarn workspace @snailycad/client build
```

## 5. Starting the CAD

Once you've followed all the above steps, we can restart the CAD again with the following command:

### Docker

```bash
docker-compose -f production.docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Standalone

**Client**

```bash
yarn workspace @snailycad/client start
```

**API**

```bash
yarn workspace @snailycad/api start
```
