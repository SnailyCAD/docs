### Reverse Proxies

Once you have installed SnailyCAD, you should setup a reverse proxy to access SnailyCAD via a domain name.
This is recommended to improve security and performance. For less experienced users, we recommend using Cloudflare Tunnels. If you're a more advanced user/developer, or are already using a proxy listed below, you should use NGINX or Apache.
