# `sna-alpr`

This must be used together with the [Wraith ARS 2X resource](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-wraith-ars-2x-police-radar-and-plate-reader-v1-3-1/1058277).
When a player runs a plate, it will automatically search the plate in your SnailyCAD instance.

## Installation

:::caution `sna-sync` requirement
Since `sna-alpr@0.10.0`, `sna-sync` is required to be installed. This allows us to use a custom notification system. [Read more about `sna-sync` here](/docs/fivem-integrations/scripts/sna-sync)
:::

1. Download the latest release from the [releases tab](https://github.com/SnailyCAD/fivem-integrations/releases/latest). Make sure to only download the `.zip` files
2. Create a `[sna]` folder to orginize all your SnailyCAD integrations.
3. Extract the `.zip` file into the `[sna]` folder.
4. Add the following to your `server.cfg` file:

```
ensure sna-alpr
```

## Configuration
