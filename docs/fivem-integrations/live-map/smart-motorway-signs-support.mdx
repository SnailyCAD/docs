# London Studios SmartMotorways Signs Support

Since [`sna-live-map@0.2.0`](https://github.com/SnailyCAD/live-map/releases/latest) we have added support for London Studios SmartMotorways signs.
This allows dispatchers to view all SmartSigns and allows dispatchers with the `Manage Smart Motorway Signs` permission to edit SmartMotorway signs directly on the Dispatch Live Map.
