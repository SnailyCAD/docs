# How to change the default postals

The SnailyCAD FiveM integrations support defining custom postal codes. See the steps below to change the default postals.

## Steps

:::warning

The `sna-postals` resource **must** be named **`sna-postals`**. It will use default postals if it's not named correctly.

:::

1. Download [`sna-postals` from the latest release](https://github.com/SnailyCAD/fivem-integrations/releases)
2. Extract the zip folder into your `resources` folder (**Folder must be named: `sna-postals`**)
3. Add `ensure sna-postals` to your `server.cfg` file
4. Edit the `postals.json` file in the `sna-postals` folder to fit your needs
5. Restart your server
