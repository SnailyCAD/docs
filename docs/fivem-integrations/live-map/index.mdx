2. Extract and place in your resources folder (`resources/sna-live-map`)
3. Update your server.cfg:

```bash
set socket_port 30121 # `sna-live-map` default socket port

ensure sna-live-map
```

4. Start the resource in your server.

## Connecting to SnailyCADv4 without SSL

1. Start the resource in your server.
2. Open the CAD-Settings page and head to the `Live Map` tab.
3. Find the `Live map URL` field and paste your copied URL.
   - `http://FIVEM_SERVER_IP:PORT`. Example: `http://182.148.288.102:30121`.

5. All done!

## Connecting to SnailyCADv4 with SSL

1. Start the resource in your server.
2. Open the CAD-Settings page and head to the `Live Map` tab.
3. Find the `Live map URL` field and enter the URL to your CAD Client.
   - Example: `https://cad.example.com`
4. In your nginx config for the CAD Client add the following to the config with your FiveM Server IP:

```bash
server {
   server_name cad.example.com
   ...
   location /socket.io/ {
    proxy_pass http://FIVEM_SERVER_IP:30121$uri$is_args$args;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  }
}
```

5. Validate your nginx config `nginx -t` and if its successful then run `nginx -s reload`
6. Now your Live Map on the CAD should update displaying players without showing any errors

## Troubleshooting

- When experiencing issues with the Live Map always review your browser console (usually F12) and check for any present errors that might suggest why the live map connection is failing.
- Players will need their Discord ID and/or Steam ID on their CAD account to show on the live map
