## Connecting to SnailyCADv4

:::caution
When specifying your `Live map URL` you must ensure it is the same content type as your CAD. If your CAD uses HTTPS so must your Live Map URL, you can do this by proxying it with a domain name and SSL certificate in the same way as your CAD URL.

2. Open the CAD-Settings page and head to the `Misc Settings` tab.
3. Find the `Live map URL` field and paste your copied URL from step.
   -> `http://FIVEM_SERVER_IP:PORT`. Example: `http://182.148.288.102:30121`.
