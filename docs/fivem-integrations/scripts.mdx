SnailyCAD has several FiveM integrations.

- `sna-call911`: `/call911`
- `sna-calltow`: `/calltow`
- `sna-calltaxi`: `/calltaxi`
- `sna-alpr`: ALPR integration that connects with [Wraith ARS 2x](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-wraith-ars-2x-police-radar-and-plate-reader-v1-3-1/1058277)
- `sna-postals`: define custom postals for the scripts above. [Learn here how to change them](/docs/fivem-integrations/custom-postals)

## Downloads

You can [view the releases here](https://github.com/SnailyCAD/fivem-integrations/releases). You must download the `.zip` files. **Not the source code**

## Setting up the scripts

### Configuration

To use these scripts, you must add a few options in your `server.cfg` file.

```conf
set snailycad_url "http://api.example.com/v1"
set snailycad_api_key "XXXXXX"
setr snailycad_use_postal "true"
```

- `snailycad_url`: The full URL/IP to your SnailyCADv4 **API**.
- `snailycad_api_key`: The API Token for SnailyCADv4. This can be obtained via the CAD-settings -> "Api Token" tab
- `snailycad_use_postal`: Whether it should use pre-defined postals [(How to change them)](/docs/fivem-integrations/custom-postals). `"true"` or `"false"`

### FXServer

2. Add the following to your `server.cfg` file

```conf
ensure sna-alpr
ensure sna-call911
ensure sna-calltow
