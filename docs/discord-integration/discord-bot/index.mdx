# Discord Bot Integration

SnailyCAD now has a bot which can be used to call emergency, tow and taxi services.

## Requirements

All the items listed below are required to use the bot.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **(18.x is supported.)** ([Windows Guide](https://youtu.be/rp308wNdXU8)) ([Linux Guide](/docs/guides/requirements/how-to-install-node-yarn-npm-linux))
- [yarn](https://npmjs.com/package/yarn) **(`npm install --global yarn`)** ([Windows Guide](https://youtu.be/rp308wNdXU8)) ([Linux Guide](/docs/guides/requirements/how-to-install-node-yarn-npm-linux#yarn))
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) **(version 14 or higher)** ([Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKWZvafvqwM))

## Installation

### 1. Cloning the GitHub repository

:::caution

<span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Warning:</span> Do not install the bot in the root folder. Install
it in your <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Documents </span>
folder on Windows or <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>home</span> folder on Linux.

To fix this, run the following command:

**Windows**

```bash
cd Documents
```

**Linux**

```bash
cd /home/$(whoami)
```

:::

Firstly, we need to clone the GitHub repository to our local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnailyCAD/snailycad-bot.git
```

Once the files have been cloned from GitHub, we can enter that folder:

```bash
cd snailycad-bot
```

### 2. Installing dependencies

Now we will install the dependencies that are required for the bot to function properly.

```bash
yarn
```

### 3. Configuration

Configuration can be a bit complicated, so pay close attention. The following steps will help you configure the bot's environment variables.
These variables are used by the bot to connect to the database.

_**Tip:** In support channels, this will be referenced as the `.env` file._

#### 3.1 Copy .env.example to .env

We must first copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

**Windows:**

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

**Linux:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now we can start configuring the variables in the `.env` file. See next step [3.2 .env file](#32-env-info).

#### 3.2 .env info

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The password to the PostgreSQL database.
- `POSTGRES_USER`: The username to the PostgreSQL database.
- `DB_HOST`: The database host. _Most likely `localhost`_
- `DB_PORT`: The port to the database.
- `POSTGRES_DB`: The database name.
- `BOT_TOKEN`: The token to your [bot application.](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

### 4. Build the bot

```bash
yarn build
```

### 5. Starting the bot

After completing all the steps above, we are ready to start the bot. To do this run the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

:::tip

You can also start the SnailyCAD bot with `pm2`. Make sure to install it first.

```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
pm2 start yarn --name "snailycad-bot" -- start
```
