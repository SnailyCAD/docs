# Discord Verified Roles

SnailyCAD allows you to create a [Discord Verified Role integration](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8063233404823).
With this you can automatically assign a Discord role to a member
when they authenticate their Discord via SnailyCAD.

### How to enable this

:::warning
You must first follow the steps for [Discord Bot Integration](/docs/discord-integration/discord-bot) and [Discord Authentication](/docs/discord-integration/discord-authentication).
:::

1. Head to the [Developer Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) page.
2. Click on the application you created for the Discord Bot Integration.
3. Find the "Linked Roles Verification URL" input field.
4. Enter the **same URL that you used for the Discord Authentication**.
5. Click "Save Changes".
6. [Try it out!](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8063233404823#h_01GK286J648XF4HPGKZYW9AMQF)
