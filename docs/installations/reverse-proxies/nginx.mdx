# NGINX Reverse Proxy Guide

:::caution
This guide is targetted for Linux (Debian, Ubuntu) users. [A Windows based guide can be found here](/docs/installations/reverse-proxies/nginx-windows)
:::

## Terminology

- **API**: The API of SnailyCAD - the backend.
- **Client**: The client (UI) of SnailyCAD - the frontend.
- **NGINX**: NGINX is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.

## 1. Installing NGINX

First, we need to install NGINX. To do this, we will use the `apt` package manager. To install NGINX, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

## 2. Configuring NGINX

Next, we need to configure NGINX. To do this, we will use the `nano` text editor. We will separate the configuration for the API and the client.

### 2.1 Configuring NGINX for SnailyCAD's API

To open the NGINX configuration file, run the following command:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/cad-api
```

Now, we need to add the following configuration to the file:

```bash
# SnailyCAD API Reverse Proxy
server {
  # Replace `example.com` with your domain name.
  server_name cad-api.example.com;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080; # The API port of SnailyCAD's API (Default: 8080)
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }


  # Security headers
  add_header X-XSS-Protection          "1; mode=block" always;
  add_header X-Content-Type-Options    "nosniff" always;
  add_header Referrer-Policy           "no-referrer" always;
  add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
  add_header X-DNS-Prefetch-Control on;
  add_header Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy "same-site";
  add_header X-Frame-Options DENY always;

  # keep this as-is unless you know what you're doing.
  # for SSL, see step 6
  listen 80;
}
```

:::tip
To save the file, press `CTRL + X` and then `Y` to confirm.

### 2.2 Configuring NGINX for SnailyCAD's client (UI)

Again, to open the NGINX configuration file, run the following command:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/cad-client
```

Now, we need to add the following configuration to the file:

```bash
# SnailyCAD Client Reverse Proxy
server {
  # Replace `example.com` with your domain name.
  server_name cad.example.com;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; # The API port of SnailyCAD's client (Default: 3000)
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }


  # Security headers
  add_header X-XSS-Protection          "1; mode=block" always;
  add_header X-Content-Type-Options    "nosniff" always;
  add_header Referrer-Policy           "no-referrer" always;
  add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
  add_header X-DNS-Prefetch-Control on;
  add_header Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy "same-site";
  add_header X-Frame-Options DENY always;

  # keep this as-is unless you know what you're doing.
  # for SSL, see step 6
  listen 80;
}
```

:::tip
To save the file, press `CTRL + X` and then `Y` to confirm.

### 2.3 Verify NGINX configuration

To verify the NGINX configuration, run the following command:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If the configuration is valid, you should see the following output:

```bash
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

## 3. Enabling NGINX configuration

Now, we need to enable the NGINX configuration. To do this, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/cad-api /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/cad-client /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

## 4. Restarting NGINX

Finally, we need to restart NGINX. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

:::tip
SnailyCAD is now running behind NGINX. You can now access SnailyCAD by visiting `http://cad.example.com` with the API accessible via `http://cad-api.example.com`.
:::

## 5. Enabling Firewall

To enable the firewall, we will use the `ufw` tool. To install `ufw`, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install ufw
```

Now, we need to allow the SSH, HTTP and HTTPS ports. To do this, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https
```

Now, we need to enable the firewall. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

:::tip
You will be asked to confirm the action. Type `y` and press `Enter` to confirm.
:::

## 6. SSL

To enable SSL, we will use the `certbot` tool. To install `certbot`, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

Now, we need to generate the SSL certificate. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
certbot --nginx
```

:::tip
You will be asked to enter your email address and agree to the terms of service.
Once accepted the ToS, Certbot will ask you to select the domain name you want to generate the SSL certificate for.
Select the domain name you want to generate the SSL certificate for and press `Enter`.
:::

Now, Certbot will generate the SSL certificate for you. Once it's done, you should see the following output:

```bash
Certificate Deployed
Successfully deployed certificate for https://cad.example.com
#...
```

## 7. Updating SnailyCAD configuration

You must now update the SnailyCAD configuration to use the SSL certificate. To do this, open the SnailyCAD `.env` file:

```bash
# This is the URL to your site where the CAD is hosted.
CORS_ORIGIN_URL="https://cad.example.com"

# This is the URL to your site where the CAD is hosted.
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL="https://cad.example.com"

# The URL to where the API is hosted.
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_ORIGIN="https://cad-api.example.com/v1"

# The domain of your site. Without any subdomains or paths.
DOMAIN="example.com"
```

:::tip
Replace `example.com` with your domain name.
:::

:::tip
You can now access SnailyCAD via `https://cad.example.com` with the API accessible via `https://cad-api.example.com`.
:::

## Troubleshooting

If you are having issues with NGINX, you can check the NGINX logs. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```
