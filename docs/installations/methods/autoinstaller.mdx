# Autoinstaller

This guide explains how to setup SnailyCADv4 **with an automated installer process**

## Requirements

All the items listed below are required to get the CAD up and running smoothly.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **(16.6+ is required.)**
- [yarn](https://npmjs.com/package/yarn) **(`npm install --global yarn`)**
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) **(version 12 or higher)**

## Installing the CAD

Once you've got all the items installed, we can get started with installing SnailyCADv4.

### Getting Started

To get started, open the Command Prompt on Windows or the Terminal on Linux.

Once it has opened, run the following commands. This will automatically run the commands of the [Standalone installation](/docs/installations/methods/standalone) and will ask questions where needed.

_`curl` is supported on all operating systems._

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SnailyCAD/autoinstaller/main/dist/index.js > script.js

node script.js
```

### Startng SnailyCAD

After completing all the steps above, we are ready to startup the CAD. To do this run the following command:

```bash
yarn run concurrently "yarn workspace @snailycad/client start" "yarn workspace @snailycad/api generate && yarn workspace @snailycad/api start"
```
