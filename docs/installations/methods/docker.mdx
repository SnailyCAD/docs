# Docker Installation

## Requirements

All the items listed below are required to get the CAD up and running smoothly.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) ([Windows Guide](https://youtu.be/EsNgheQPZs4)) ([Linux Guide](/docs/guides/requirements/how-to-install-git-linux))
- [Docker Desktop](https://docker.com/get-started) (Windows), [Docker](https://docker.com/get-started) (Linux)

## Getting Started

Once you've got all the items installed, we can get started with installing SnailyCADv4.
Open the Command Prompt on Windows or the Terminal on Linux.

### 1. Cloning the GitHub repository

:::caution

<span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Warning:</span> Do not install SnailyCADv4 in the root folder. Install
it in your <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Documents </span>
folder on Windows or <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>home</span> folder on Linux.

To fix this, run the following command:

**Windows**

```bash
cd Documents
```

**Linux**

```bash
cd /home/$(whoami)
```

:::

Firstly, we need to clone the GitHub repository to our local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnailyCAD/snaily-cadv4.git
```

<img src="/gifs/git-clone.gif" alt="Git clone short clip" loading="lazy" width="600px" />

Once the files have been cloned from GitHub, we can enter that folder:

```bash
cd snaily-cadv4
```

<img src="/gifs/cd.gif" alt="Change directory short clip" loading="lazy" width="600px" />

### 2. Configuration

Configuration can be a bit complicated, so pay close attention. The following steps will help you configure SnailyCADv4's environment variables.
These variables are used by SnailyCADv4 to connect to the database and store special tokens used for SnailyCAD's features.
_**Tip:** In support channels, this will be referenced as the `.env` file._

We must first copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

**Windows:**

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

**Linux:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

<img src="/gifs/move-env.gif" alt="Move env short clip" loading="lazy" width="600px" />

Now we can start configuring the variables in the `.env` file. See next step [3.1 .env file](#31-env-info).

#### 2.1 .env info

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The password to the PostgreSQL database.
- `POSTGRES_USER`: The username to the PostgreSQL database.
- `DB_HOST`: The database host.
- `DB_PORT`: The port to the database.
- `POSTGRES_DB`: The database name.
- `JWT_SECRET`: This is a random value to keep the CAD secured.
- `CORS_ORIGIN_URL`: The URL/IP to where the CAD is hosted at, e.g., `https://cad.mysite.com` or `http://99.99.00.190:3000`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL`: The URL/IP to where the CAD is hosted at. e.g.: `https://cad.mysite.com` or `http://99.99.00.190:3000`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_ORIGIN`: The URL/IP to where the API is hosted at (**`/v1` is required.**). e.g.: `https://cad-api.mysite.com/v1` or `http://99.99.00.190:8080/v1`.
- `PORT_API`: The port where the API should run on. _(Default 8080)_
- `PORT_CLIENT`: The port where the client should run on. _(Default: 3000)_
- `ENCRYPTION_TOKEN`: Used to generate encrypted values. **Must be 32 characters long**
- `DATABASE_URL`: **Do not change unless you know what you're doing!**

```bash
# Documentation can be found at: https://docs.snailycad.org/docs/installations

# This is the password to the postgress database.
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="Y8CURkTv"

# This is the username to the postgress database.
POSTGRES_USER="postgres"

# The database host - Set as 'postgres' when using docker compose
DB_HOST="postgres"

# The database port - keep port as '5432' when using docker compose
DB_PORT="5432"

# The database name.
POSTGRES_DB="snaily-cad-v4"

# This is a random value to keep the CAD's cookies secured. Make sure to change this!
JWT_SECRET="GxuPM0XmlxvCDX0QfZeqLSo0uvNm3FsEZN56JRZYNSU="

# string of 32 characters long. Make sure to change this!
# Generate one at: https://codebeautify.org/generate-random-string

# This is the URL/IP to your site where the CAD is hosted.
# -> e.g. https://cad.mysite.com or http://99.99.00.190:3000
CORS_ORIGIN_URL="https://cad.example.com"

# The URL/IP to where the API is hosted.
# -> e.g. https://cad-api.mysite.com/v1 or http://99.99.00.190:8080/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_ORIGIN="https://cad-api.example.com/v1"

# only enter this value if you're using a domain!
# domain should only be the domain, NOT including sub-domains

# "true" or "false"

# The port of which the API will run on. Default: 8080
# When using Docker, make sure to change this in the `production.docker-compose.yml` file too.
PORT_API=8080

# The port of which the client will run on. Default: 3000
PORT_CLIENT=3000

# Errors get reported to Linear (Project manager). This is done so errors can be fixed faster.

```

</details>

#### 2.2 Docker network

Now we must setup a Docker network so the CAD can communicate with it's services.

```
docker network create cad_web
```

### 3. Building everything

Now we must build the Docker container. This will automatically install the dependencies build the packages and more.

:::caution
This command must **always** be run after changing the `.env` file
:::

```bash
docker compose -f production.docker-compose.yml build
```

### 4. Starting SnailyCADv4

After completing all the steps above, we are ready to startup the CAD. To do this run the following command:

_**Note:** When running the command for the fist time, this will
pull down all services from the Docker Hub. This can take a few minutes._

```bash
docker compose -f production.docker-compose.yml up -d
```

:::tip Docker tips

- **Stop SnailyCADv4:** enter `docker compose -f production.docker-compose.yml down` in a command prompt/terminal in the directory where you installed the CAD and wait for the services to stop.

- **View SnailyCADv4 logs:** enter `docker compose -f production.docker-compose.yml logs` in a command prompt/terminal in the directory where you installed the CAD.

:::

### 5. Accessing SnailyCADv4

:::info Port forwarding
The ports set for the client and API **must be forwarded** in your firewall if you're **not** using some proxy.

Default ports:

- **Client port**: `3000`
- **API port**: `8080`
- **Proxy ports:** `443` and `80`

:::

:::caution localhost
You cannot use `localhost` to access SnailyCADv4. It will not work!
:::

By default, you can access SnailyCADv4 via a web browser on your [LAN IP](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-local-ip-address) and the `PORT_CLIENT`, example: `http://192.168.92.20:3000`. However, if you want to access SnailyCADv4 via a domain, you must setup a reverse proxy.
We have guides for [NGINX](/docs/installations/reverse-proxies/nginx), an [Apache Guide](https://apache.org) can be found here.
