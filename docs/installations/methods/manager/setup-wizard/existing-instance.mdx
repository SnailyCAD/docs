### 4. Setup

Since the SnailyCAD instance had already been setup before, there shouldn't be any more steps required to get started.
The SnailyCAD Manager will restart and load you straight into the dashboard.

### 5. Configuration

Once the SnailyCAD instance has been setup, you must configure the environment variables in the ENV Editor.
You can find the ENV Editor in `Additional Tools` -> `ENV Editor`.
