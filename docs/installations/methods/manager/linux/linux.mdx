# SnailyCAD Manager Linux

This guide will show you how to install the SnailyCAD Manager on Linux.

:::note
This has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS. If you are using a different distribution, the commands may be different, however the process should be similar.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure of the following:

- You have a working internet connection.
- You have all [requirements](/docs/installations/methods/manager#1-requirements) installed.

## Installation

:::warning
SnailyCAD Manager v3 will only work with new instances of SnailyCAD. If you want to move an existing instance to SnailyCAD Manager v3, you will need to copy all values from the other instances's `.env` file.
:::

1. Login as root (required)

   ```bash
   sudo -i
   ```

2. Run the SnailyCAD Manager installer

   ```bash
   pnpm create snailycad-manager
   ```

3. Done ðŸŽ‰

   SnailyCAD Manager has been installed, and will be available on port `60120` by default.

## Installation Directories

SnailyCAD Manager creates the following directories:

- `/root/.snailycad-manager` - The SnailyCAD Manager root directory.
- `/root/.scm-instances` - Where all SnailyCAD instances are stored.

## Command Line Interface

SnailyCAD Manager comes with a (work in progress) command line interface (CLI) to manage both SnailyCAD Manager, and SnailyCAD instances.

Read more about the CLI [here](/docs/installations/methods/manager/cli).
