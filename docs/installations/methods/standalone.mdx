# Standalone installation

This guide explains how to setup your own SnailyCADv4 instance **without Docker**.

## Requirements

All the items listed below are required to get SnailyCADv4 up and running smoothly.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) ([Windows Guide](https://youtu.be/EsNgheQPZs4)) ([Linux Guide](/docs/guides/requirements/how-to-install-git-linux))
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **(18.x is supported.)** ([Windows Guide](https://youtu.be/qfo5MaqQgIo)) ([Linux Guide](/docs/guides/requirements/how-to-install-node-pnpm-npm-linux))
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) ([Windows Guide](https://youtu.be/qfo5MaqQgIo)) ([Linux Guide](/docs/guides/requirements/how-to-install-node-pnpm-npm-linux))
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) **(version 14 or higher)** ([Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKWZvafvqwM)) ([Linux Guide](/docs/guides/requirements/how-to-install-postgresql-linux))

## Getting Started

Once you've got all the items installed, we can get started with installing SnailyCADv4.
Open the Command Prompt on Windows or the Terminal on Linux.

### 1. Cloning the GitHub repository

:::warning

<span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Warning:</span> Do not install SnailyCADv4 in the root folder. Install
it in your <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Documents </span>
folder on Windows or <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>home</span> folder on Linux.

To fix this, run the following command:

**Windows**

```bash
cd Documents
```

**Linux**

```bash
cd /home/$(whoami)
```

:::

Firstly, we need to clone the GitHub repository to our local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnailyCAD/snaily-cadv4.git
```

<img src="/gifs/git-clone.gif" alt="Git clone short clip" loading="lazy" width="600px" />

Once the files have been cloned from GitHub, we can enter that folder:

```bash
cd snaily-cadv4
```

<img src="/gifs/cd.gif" alt="Change directory short clip" loading="lazy" width="600px" />

### 2. Installing dependencies

Now we will install the dependencies that are required for SnailyCADv4 to function properly.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configuration

**Configuration can be a bit complicated, so pay close attention.** The following steps will help you configure SnailyCADv4's environment variables.
These variables are used by SnailyCADv4 to connect to the database and store special tokens used for SnailyCAD's features.

:::tip
In the support channels, this will be referenced as the ".env file" or "ENV".
:::

We must first copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

**Windows:**

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

**Linux:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

<img src="/gifs/move-env.gif" alt="Move env short clip" loading="lazy" width="600px" />

Now we can start configuring the variables in the `.env` file. See next step [3.1 .env file](#31-env-info).

#### 3.1 .env info

:::warning
**WARNING:** Please, do not edit `apps/client/.env` or `apps/api/.env` directly. Always edit the root `.env` file.

When changing something in the `.env` file after the installation process, make sure to run the following steps:

1. `node scripts/copy-env.mjs --client --api`
2. `pnpm turbo run build --filter=@snailycad/client`

[Read more here](/docs/guides/env/how-to-properly-update-env)

:::

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The password to the PostgreSQL database.
- `POSTGRES_USER`: The username to the PostgreSQL database.
- `DB_HOST`: The database host. _Most likely `localhost`_
- `DB_PORT`: The port to the database.
- `POSTGRES_DB`: The database name.
- `JWT_SECRET`: This is a random value to keep the CAD secured.
- `CORS_ORIGIN_URL`: The URL/IP to where the CAD is hosted at, e.g., `https://cad.mysite.com` or `http://99.99.00.190:3000`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL`: The URL/IP to where the CAD is hosted at. e.g.: `https://cad.mysite.com` or `http://99.99.00.190:3000`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_ORIGIN`: The URL/IP to where the API is hosted at (**`/v1` is required.**). e.g.: `https://cad-api.mysite.com/v1` or `http://99.99.00.190:8080/v1`.
- `PORT_API`: The port where the API should run on. _(Default 8080)_
- `PORT_CLIENT`: The port where the client should run on. _(Default: 3000)_
- `ENCRYPTION_TOKEN`: Used to generate encrypted values. **Must be 32 characters long**
- `DATABASE_URL`: **Do not change unless you know what you're doing!**

:::warning
Do **not** use `localhost` for Accessing SnailyCAD. It will not work!

:::tip
**Please take a few minutes and read the [in-depth guide for each environment variable here](/docs/guides/env/reference).**

```bash
# Documentation can be found at: https://docs.snailycad.org/docs/installations

# This is the password to the postgress database.
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="Y8CURkTv"

# This is the username to the postgress database.
POSTGRES_USER="postgres"

# The database host - Set as 'postgres' when using docker compose
DB_HOST="localhost"

# The database port - keep port as '5432' when using docker compose
DB_PORT="5432"

# The database name.
POSTGRES_DB="snaily-cad-v4"

# This is a random value to keep the CAD's cookies secured. Make sure to change this!
JWT_SECRET="GxuPM0XmlxvCDX0QfZeqLSo0uvNm3FsEZN56JRZYNSU="

# string of 32 characters long. Make sure to change this!
# Generate one at: https://codebeautify.org/generate-random-string

# This is the URL/IP to your site where the CAD is hosted.
# -> e.g. https://cad.mysite.com or http://99.99.00.190:3000
CORS_ORIGIN_URL="https://cad.example.com"

# The URL/IP to where the API is hosted.
# -> e.g. https://cad-api.mysite.com/v1 or http://99.99.00.190:8080/v1

```

</details>

#### 3.2 Moving env file

Once you've **correctly configured all the variables**, we must copy the `.env` file to the client and API:

**Windows/Linux:**

```bash
node scripts/copy-env.mjs --client --api
```

<img src="/gifs/copy-env.gif" alt="copy env short clip" loading="lazy" width="600px" />

### 4. Building everything

Now we must build all the packages & apps. _(client, schemas, config, types)_

_**Note:** this process might take 2 to 5minutes_

```bash
pnpm run build
```

<img src="/gifs/turbo-build.gif" alt="turbo build short clip" loading="lazy" width="600px" />

### 5. Starting SnailyCADv4

After completing all the steps above, we are ready to startup the CAD. To do this run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run start
```

:::tip
To run SnailyCADv4 in the background, [you can use PM2](/docs/guides/how-to-start-with-pm2) instead of the command above.
:::

### 6. Accessing SnailyCADv4

:::info Port forwarding
The ports set for the client and API **must be forwarded** in your firewall if you're **not** using some proxy.

Default ports:

- **Client port**: `3000`
- **API port**: `8080`
- **Proxy ports:** `443` and `80`

:::

:::warning localhost
You cannot use `localhost` to access SnailyCADv4. It will not work!
:::

By default, you can access SnailyCADv4 via a web browser on your [LAN IP](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-local-ip-address) and the `PORT_CLIENT`, example: `http://192.168.92.20:3000`. However, if you want to access SnailyCADv4 via a domain, you must setup a reverse proxy.
We have guides for [NGINX](/docs/installations/reverse-proxies/nginx), an [Apache Guide](https://apache.org) can be found here.
