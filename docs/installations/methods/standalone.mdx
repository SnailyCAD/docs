# Standalone installation

This guide explains how to setup SnailyCADv4 **without Docker**.

You can also find [a video guide here](https://youtu.be/06NiiO8-rIM)

## Requirements

All the items listed below are required to get the CAD up and running smoothly.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **(16.6+ is required.)**
- [yarn](https://npmjs.com/package/yarn) **(`npm install --global yarn`)**
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) **(version 12 or higher)**

## Installing the CAD

Once you've got all the items installed, we can get started with installing SnailyCADv4.

### Getting Started

To get started, open the Command Prompt on Windows or the Terminal on Linux.

### Cloning the GitHub repository

:::caution

<span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Warning:</span> do not install the CAD in the root folder. Install
the CAD in your <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Documents</span>
folder for Windows or <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>home</span> folder for linux.

To fix this, run the following command:

**Windows**

```bash
cd Documents
```

**Linux**

```bash
cd /home/$(whoami)
```

:::

First we'll need to clone to repo to our own machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnailyCAD/snaily-cadv4.git
```

Once it finishes, we can enter the folder

```bash
cd snaily-cadv4
```

### Installing dependencies

Now we'll install the dependencies that are required to start SnailyCADv4.

```bash
yarn
```

### Configuration

We'll setup the envrionment variables now, firslty we must copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.

**Windows:**

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

**Linux:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now open the `.env` file and edit it's contents. View more info below.

#### .env info

:::caution

<span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Warning:</span> When changing anything in the `.env` file, make
sure to run the following steps:

1. `node scripts/copy-env.mjs --client --api`
2. `yarn workspace @snailycad/client build`

:::

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: the password to the postgress database.
- `POSTGRES_USER`: the username to the postgress database.
- `DB_HOST`: The database host.
- `DB_PORT`: The port to the databse.
- `POSTGRES_DB`: The database name.
- `DATABASE_URL`: **Do not change unless you know what you're doing!**
- `JWT_SECRET`: This is a random value to keep the CAD secured.
- `CORS_ORIGIN_URL`: This is the URL to your site where the CAD is hosted, eg `https://cad.mysite.com` or `http://99.99.00.190:3000`, or use a wildcard to allow on all sites `*`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_ORIGIN`: The URL/IP to where the API is hosted eg `https://cad-api.mysite.com/v1` or `http://99.99.00.190:8000/v1`. When testing this locally (on `localhost`), keep as is.
- `PORT_API`: The port where you want to run the API at. _(Default 8080)_
- `PORT_CLIENT`: The port where you want to run the client at. _(Default: 3000)_

#### Moving env file

Once you've configured the file. Make sure to copy it to the correct directories:

**Windows/Linux:**

```bash
node scripts/copy-env.mjs --client --api
```

### Building everything

Now we must build all the packages again. _(client, schemas, config, types)_

```bash
yarn turbo run build
```

### Starting SnailyCADv4

After completing all the steps above, we are ready to startup the CAD. To do this run the following command:

```bash
yarn run concurrently "yarn workspace @snailycad/client start" "yarn workspace @snailycad/api generate && yarn workspace @snailycad/api start"
```
