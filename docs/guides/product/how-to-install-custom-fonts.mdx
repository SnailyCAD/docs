# How to install custom fonts

In this guide you will learn how to install custom fonts for SnailyCADv4

### 1. Download the font

You must download your font as a `.woff2` or `.ttf` type. These are the latest web font types.

### 2. Install the font

Once you've downloaded your font, it needs to be placed in a special folder: `./apps/client/public/fonts`.

:::info
If the `./apps/client/public/fonts` folder does not exist yet, you can create it. Once created, place your font in the `./apps/client/public/fonts` folder.

### 3. Add required CSS to use the font

We must now edit some code to include this font in the client. Open the file: `apps/client/src/styles/fonts.scss`.

Now add the following to the file:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "MyFontNameHere";
  src: url("../../public/fonts/MyFontNameHere.woff2");
  font-display: swap;
}
```

Once you've added the font-face to the file, we must now update the old font name to the new font name.
**Search for:**

```css
html,
body,
#map-calls,
.leaflet-container {
  font-family: "Assistant", sans-serif;
}
```

and **Replace with:**

```css
html,
body,
#map-calls,
.leaflet-container {
  font-family: "MyFontNameHere", sans-serif;
}
```

### 4. Rebuild your SnailyCAD instance

<Tabs groupId="installation-method">
  <TabItem value="standalone" label="Standalone" default>

If you are running SnailyCAD standalone, you can run the following command to rebuild the client:

```bash
yarn turbo run build --filter="{packages/**/**}" && yarn turbo run build --filter="{apps/**/**}"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

If you are running SnailyCAD with Docker, you can run the following command to rebuild the client:

```bash
docker compose -f production.docker-compose.yml build
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 5. Start your SnailyCAD instance
