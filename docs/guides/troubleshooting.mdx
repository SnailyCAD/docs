## "An unknown error occurred" on registration

You're getting an error message stating `An unknown error occurred` once you try register for the first time. This should be a simple fix!
Verify with the steps below that you've setup everything correctly.

- Is the API online and able to accept connections?
  - Yes:
    - Make sure you entered the correct IP/domain of where your API is hosted at.
    - Make sure that you've correctly entered the `CORS_ORIGIN_URL` in the `.env` file.
  - No:
    - Make sure there are no errors on startup
    - Make sure the required ports are forwared (`8080` and `3000`)
    - Make sure you've setup your IP/domain correctly in the `.env` file.

## "Error listen: EADDRINUSE: address already in use"

This means a port is already being utilized on your machine, make sure to stop that service.
If there is no service running on that port try restarting your PC.

## "UNAUTHORIZED" errors in the API console

You can safely ignore these errors.

## "Mixed Content"

Your API and client must both be either on `https://` or `http://`. **It cannot be mixed**

## .env file conflicts

This is just a warning that can be ignored.

## "P1000: Authentication Faild against database ..."

![invalid_db_creds](/invalid_db_creds.png)

Make your credentials are correct to the database. The default username for PostgreSQL is `postgres`.

If you installed `PgAdmin`, it should've asked to enter a password, you must enter the same password in your .env file.
