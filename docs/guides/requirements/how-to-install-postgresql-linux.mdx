# How to install PostgreSQL on Linux

In this short guide you will learn how to install PostgreSQL for SnailyCADv4 on Linux.

:::info
This guide is mainly directed for users using Ubuntu. However, most commands will work for any Linux distro
:::

## Installing PostgreSQL

Here we will update the apt packages and install PostgreSQL

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install postgresql-14 postgresql-contrib
```

## Starting PostgreSQL service

Now we must start the PostgreSQL service. This will allow us to connect to the database.

```bash
sudo systemctl start postgresql.service
```

## PostgreSQL configuration

Firslty we must connect to the database via the command line:

```bash
psql -d postgres
```

:::caution error: FATAL: role "root" does not exist

Note that you might run into this error, if you try to execute this command as a root user:

```bash
psql: error: FATAL:  role "root" does not exist
```

To avoid it, simply switch to the postgres user:

```bash
sudo -u postgres -i
```

Then you can execute the first command that was mentionned before and you can continue with the guide.

```bash
psql -d postgres
```
