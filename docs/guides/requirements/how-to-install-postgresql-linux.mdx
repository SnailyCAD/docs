# How to install PostgreSQL on Linux

In this short guide you will learn how to install PostgreSQL for SnailyCADv4 on Linux.

:::info
This guide is mainly directed for users using Ubuntu. However, most commands will work for any Linux distro
:::

## Installing PostgreSQL

Here we will update the apt packages and install PostgreSQL

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install postgresql-14 postgresql-contrib
```

## Starting PostgreSQL service

Now we must start the PostgreSQL service. This will allow us to connect to the database.

```bash
sudo systemctl start postgresql.service
```

## PostgreSQL configuration

Firslty we must connect to the database via the command line:

```bash
psql -d postgres
```

Note that you might run into this error, if you try to execute this command as a root user:

:::caution
This is the error you might get: `psql: error: FATAL:  role "root" does not exist`
*(Note that the role might change based of what user you're logged in)*
:::

To avoid it, simply execute the command as the postgres user, by executing this command (No password should be needed):

```bash
sudo -u postgres -i
```

Then you can execute the first command that was mentionned before `psql -d postgres` and you can continue with the guide.

### Creating SnailyCAD user

**Create user**

:::caution
This username must match the `POSTGRES_USER` in your ENV/.env file.
:::

```sql
`postgres=#` CREATE USER "snailycad";
```

**set permissions**

```sql
`postgres=#` ALTER USER "snailycad" WITH SUPERUSER;
```

**setting a password**

:::caution
This password must match the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in your ENV/.env file.
:::

```sql
`postgres=#` ALTER USER "snailycad" PASSWORD 'replace-with-your-password';
```

### Creating SnailyCADv4 database

:::caution
This database name must match the `POSTGRES_DB` in your ENV/.env file.
:::

```sql
`postgres=#` CREATE DATABASE "snaily-cadv4";
```

## Next steps

Now you've successfully setup PostgreSQL on Ubuntu for SnailyCADv4.
Make sure to update your `.env` file or your ENV (Manager app) to use the same values your used in this guide.
