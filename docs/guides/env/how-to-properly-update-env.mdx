# How to properly update the `.env` file

There are a few commands that are required to run to correctly update the .env file.

### 1. Stop your SnailyCAD instance

Before we can edit the `.env` file, we must first stop SnailyCAD.

:::info

Make sure you are in the same directory as your SnailyCAD instance.

<Tabs groupId="installation-method">
  <TabItem value="standalone" label="Standalone" default>

If you are running SnailyCAD standalone, you can simply press `CTRL+C` in the terminal window where SnailyCAD is running.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

If you are running SnailyCAD with Docker, you can stop SnailyCAD by running the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f production.docker-compose.yml down
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Update the ENV file

Now that SnailyCAD is stopped, we can update the `.env` file.

### 3. Building and copying

Now that we have updated the `.env` file, we need to rebuild the client and copy the `.env` file to the client and API.

<Tabs groupId="installation-method">
  <TabItem value="standalone" label="Standalone" default>

If you are running SnailyCAD standalone, you can run the following command to rebuild the client:

```bash
node scripts/copy-env.mjs --client --api && yarn turbo run build --filter="{packages/**/**}" && yarn turbo run build --filter="{apps/**/**}"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

If you are running SnailyCAD with Docker, you can run the following command to rebuild the client:

```bash
node scripts/copy-env.mjs --client --api && docker compose -f production.docker-compose.yml build
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 4. Start SnailyCAD

Now that we have updated the `.env` file, we can start SnailyCAD again.

<Tabs groupId="installation-method">
  <TabItem value="standalone" label="Standalone" default>
If you are running SnailyCAD standalone, you can run the following command to start SnailyCAD:

```bash
yarn run concurrently "yarn workspace @snailycad/client start" "yarn workspace @snailycad/api generate && yarn workspace @snailycad/api start"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">
If you are running SnailyCAD with Docker, you can run the following command to start SnailyCAD:

```bash
docker compose -f production.docker-compose.yml up -d
