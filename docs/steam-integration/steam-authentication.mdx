# Steam Authentication

SnailyCADv4 supports Steam authentication. Below you'll find out how to get access to it.

## Create Steam API key

If you already have an API key in the Steam developer portal, you can skip this step.

1. head to [https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
2. Generate a new API key
3. Copy the `Key` (these will be used later)

## Update `.env`

Once everything is correctly setup above, we can continue.

1. Open the `.env` file
2. Add the following lines

:::note
This must be placed at the bottom of SnailyCAD's .env file
:::

```txt
STEAM_API_KEY=""
```

3. Enter the copied API key from earlier
4. Run this command in the root of the CAD: `node scripts/copy-env.mjs --client --api`
5. Restart the entire CAD.
6. Enable the feature from the CAD Settings -> Features -> `Steam Oauth`
