# Release 1.73.0

This release includes tons of new features and bug fixes.

**London Studios SmartMotorways Support**

This **requires** the latest release of the [`sna-live-map`](https://github.com/SnailyCAD/live-map/releases) resource.
This allows dispatchers to view all SmartMotorways signs and allows dispatchers with the `Manage Smart Motorway Signs` permission to edit SmartMotorways signs directly on the Dispatch Live Map.

**Hunting & Fishing License**

Citizens can now utilize a Hunting and Fishing license. These licenses are separate from each other. They are managed the same way other licenses are managed.

**Vehicle Speed Information for Records**

When creating a record, you can now specify the speed of the vehicle. This is useful for speeding tickets.

**Open Law Book (Optional Feature)**

When enabled, any user is able to view the CAD's penal codes as a list. This is accessible via `Citizen` -> `Open Law Book`.

**Other Improvements**

- "My Record Reports" page for LEO. Allows them to view all reports the user officers have created.
- Audit log entry for Citizen Record Remove and Citizen Warrant Remove.
- Avoid changelog 403/429 errors.
- Small performance improvements while creating Discord Webhooks.
